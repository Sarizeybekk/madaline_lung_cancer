# Madaline (Multiple Adaptive Linear Neuron) - Lung Cancer Prediction System

This project implements a **Madaline (Multiple Adaptive Linear Neuron)** model to predict lung cancer risk based on specific features collected from individuals. The aim is to assist people in understanding their cancer risk at a low cost and make informed decisions based on their risk assessment.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots were used to explore the relationships between features.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Strongest positive correlation observed between `YELLOW_FINGERS` and `ANXIETY` (0.57).
  - Dataset contains no missing values.
  - Dataset balanced for most features.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

- One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables (`GENDER` and `LUNG_CANCER`).
- Binary features were mapped to `0` (No) and `1` (Yes).
- Features were scaled and split into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets using `train_test_split`.

## ü§ñ Model Implementation: Madaline

- A **Madaline Neural Network** was implemented for prediction.
- **Activation Function**: Bipolar step activation function.
- **Training Process**:
  - Weights were updated iteratively based on error correction.
  - Epoch limit: 1000
  - Learning rate: 0.01
- **Testing Process**:
  - Predictions were evaluated using the trained weights and activation logic.
